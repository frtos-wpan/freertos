This is a FreeRTOS port to the USI USI WM-N-BM-09 board, using just a
bare GCC build environment.

Architecture:	ARM Cortex M3
Chip:		STM32F207ZET6
Board:		USI WM-N-BM-09 EVB
Toolchain:	GCC (arm-linux-gnueabi)
SDK:		GNU Make
Build platform:	Linux (Ubuntu 13.04)


Application:

We integrate the Contiki OS and run an application that brings up an
IEEE 802.15.4 network.


Naming:

in case we keep this generic and want to follow existing style, the
name might be something like CORTEX_M3_STM32F207ZET-USI-WM-N-BM-09
which would be painfully long.

For now, we just use WM09.
